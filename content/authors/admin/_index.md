      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## Welcome!

I am a researcher specialized in propaganda, digital politics and political communication, with a primary focus on China and authoritarian regimes in general. I received my Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) in 2024.

I study the formal and linguistic aspects of propaganda, examining and empirically tracing how regimes use institutional mechanisms--often with deep historical roots--to replicate their messages across media platforms in contemporary China—including commercial newspapers, the internet, and even large language models (LLMs). My [recent article](publication/scripted_pnas) (co-authored with Hannah Waight, Margaret E. (Molly) Roberts, and Brandon Stewart) in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences applies a text reuse approach to detect what we call “scripted propaganda,” measuring the percentage of articles copied verbatim across more than 700 publications. Another [ongoing collaborative project](inprogress/llm) explores how scripted propaganda may influence LLM outputs.

The other body of my researches explore the role of formal and linguistic aspects of propaganda in elite politics in China. [My dissertation](inprogress/dissertation) examines how the seemingly rigid and archaic official discourse of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)—often called “hard propaganda”—serves as an intra-elite communication system, with political catchphrases (tifa, 提法) as its fundamental units. Using a corpus of 2.5 million ideological texts (1921–2019), I developed a method to extract over 25,000 catchphrases. My findings show that subtle wording changes in these catchphrases can send important political and policy signals, significantly shifting their ideological and policy positions, as quantified by word embedding-based methods. Survey evidence further indicates that these nuances are primarily recognized by political elites while remaining obscure to the general public. This enables elites to communicate sensitive political information “in plain sight” while ensuring a gradual and controlled release of ongoing elite conflicts to broader circles of political power.

Methodologically, I specialize in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning. I also have strong expertise in data visualization and interactive applications, particularly using Shiny. I am proficient in Python and R for data analysis, modeling, and visualization, experienced in SQL for data management, and skilled in command-line and version control tools, including Git and Bash.
